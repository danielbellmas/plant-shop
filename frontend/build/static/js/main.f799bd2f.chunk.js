when grown indoors. choose a location that receives at least six hours of sunlight throughout the day. string of bananas do well under grow lights as well if needed. if this plant is not receiving enough light, it will become leggy and the banana-shaped leaves will become significantly more spaced out along the stem \u2013 a look that is often considered less visually appealing.\\nwater: this hardy succulent is considered to be drought-tolerant with low water needs. there is no universal schedule for how often a string of bananas will need to be watered as this can depend on a variety of factors, but, as a general rule, the soil should be allowed to dry out completely between waterings. it is better to under-water a string of bananas than to overwater as they are highly susceptible to root rot.\\nfertilizer: as with most succulents, string of bananas does not require regular fertilizing, although they can benefit from light feedings in the spring and summer months to help boost

Orchid","price":"$135.00","image":"https://redsquareflowers.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Deluxe-White-Orchid-400x400.jpg","details":"Temperature:\\nphalaenopsis orchids enjoy a fairly warm climate. the ideal night temperature is 62 to 65 degrees f. and daytime temperature range of 70 to 80 degrees. since this temperature range is similar to that of many homes, it makes an ideal house plant.\\nlight and shade:\\nphalaenopsis orchids do not require too much light to grow well. 1000-1500 foot-candles is the ideal light intensity required for phalaenopsis. if grown in a windowsill, an east exposure proves to be the best. one must take care, though, not to burn the plant by allowing too much sunlight to shine directly on the plant. it is best to provide some shade, such as a sheer curtain, allowing perhaps a little more light to hit the plants from the beginning of december through the middle of february.\\nwatering:\\nwater your phalaenopsis orchids early in the morning. this insures complete water evaporation on the foliage as well as the crown by nightfall. water with rain, distilled, or reverse-osmosis water as the mix approaches dryness. never use water that has been softened by a water softener. generally phalaenopsis require watering about once every 4 to 7 days. plants should never stand in water! plants that stand in water or that are watered in the evening will develop bacterial or fungal rot. pull out the plant label and see if there is any water residue on it. if not, it is time for watering. the weight of the pot can also help determine whether it needs watering or not. the pot should be fairly heavy after watering.\\nfeeding:\\nwe highly recommend green jungle orchid food, especially formulated to work with rain, distilled, reverse osmosis water or water low in alkalinity. if the plant is potted in bark, fertilize with green jungle every time you water, all year round, then flush with clear water once a month. if potted in sphagnum moss, use green jungle every third watering. this is the fertilizer that we developed and use on our own plants. the results have been excellent.\\nfor tap or well water, use grow more 20-10-20 fertilizer every other watering in the summer and every third watering in the winter. fertilize at the rate of one-half teaspoon per gallon.\\nhumidity:\\nphalaenopsis orchids are of a monopodial growth without any pseudobulbs to help store moisture. for this reason, it is important to provide good humidity. 50-70% is considered ideal. however, if the plant is kept well watered, it will adapt to a lower humidity.\\nflowering:\\ncommonly referred to as the \u201cmoth orchid,\u201d phalaenopsis are one of the longest blooming orchid genera, producing flowers that last from 2 to 6 months before dropping. phalaenopsis have also been known to bloom 2 to 3 times per year once they have reached a mature size. after it has flowered the first time, cut the stem just above the node where the first flower bloomed. from the top node a new flower stem should emerge within 2 months. if there is no response or the flower spike turns brown, cut it off near the base of the plant where it emerged.\\nas shown \u2013 white six stem orchid"},{"id":"12a3b311","name":"Airplant (Tillandsia

plants because of their natural propensity to cling wherever conditions permit: telephone wires, tree branches, barks, bare rocks, etc. their light seeds and a silky parachute facilitate this spread. most tillandsia species are epiphytes \u2013 which translates to \u2018upon a plant\u2019. some are aerophytes, which have a minimal root system and grow on shifting desert soil. due to the epiphytic
